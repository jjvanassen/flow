# FLOW
#### Online JavaScript experiments and simulators investigating collective flow.

For my EU funded [research project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/896434 "Project FLOW") I developed a series of online experiments that ask observers to judge properties of collective flow (e.g. flocks of birds, swarms of bugs).

The simulator is based on this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1006/jtbi.2002.3065 "Paper") by Iain Couzin and is mostly written in JavaScript using [Three.js](https://threejs.org "Three.js").

I'm pretty sure some developers will cringe at my JS coding skills but I had to move everything online because of Covid-19 with very limited web development skills and tight deadlines. The important part is that it runs and is stable. Hopefully some other people can benefit from these scripts.

More information about this project and a realtime demo can be found on my website [janjaap.info](http://www.janjaap.info "janjaap.info").
